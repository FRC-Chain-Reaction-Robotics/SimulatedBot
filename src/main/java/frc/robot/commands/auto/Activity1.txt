For the first step in learning how to program autonomous, lets get started with a simple "Drive Forward" autonomous program.

1. Create a new DriveToDistance.java file in the appropriate spot for autonomous commands (its under the java/frc/robot/commands/auto folder b/c we are making an autonomous command)
2. Autonomous commands function differently than normal commands that are used in Teleop,
     instead of being directly referenced by any specific system, they are directly ran by 
     the DriverStation and selected before a match (we will talk about how to do that soon)
3. Extend the class PIDCommand and create overriding methods for the abstract methods in that class (i will clarify what this means)
4. Additionally override isFinished()
5.
